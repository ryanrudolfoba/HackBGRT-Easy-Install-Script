# HackBGRT Easy Install Script for Steam Deck

## About
All credits goes to Metabolix for his tool called [HackBGRT.](https://github.com/Metabolix/HackBGRT)

This tool will allow you to change the logo when Windows boots up! \
I've repackaged it and created a simple script to make the install / uninstall process easier on a Steam Deck! \
Several logos are bundled in this github repo, and they will randomize whenever Windows starts up!

If you are also using my dual boot [Clover script](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot) for the Steam Deck then no need to install this as the Clover script already contains HackBGRT. \
This will also work on regular Windows PC / handhelds as long as SecureBoot is disabled and the config needs to be adjusted to match the screen resolution.


> **NOTE**\
> If you are going to use this script for a video tutorial, PLEASE reference on your video where you got the script! This will make the support process easier!

1. Do this at your own risk!
2. This is for educational and research purposes only!
3. Don't use this if you use my Steam Deck Clover script as that already includes HackBGRT!

10. Reboot and the old logo will be restored.

## A Note About Windows Update
When Windows installs an update (monthly security update for example), it might revert the boot manager to the original and HackBGRT will be gone. When this happens, just run the uninstall and then install script.
