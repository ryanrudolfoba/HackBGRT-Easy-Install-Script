# HackBGRT Easy Install Script for Steam Deck

## About
All credits goes to Metabolix for his tool called [HackBGRT.](https://github.com/Metabolix/HackBGRT)

This tool will allow you to change the logo when Windows boots up! \
I've repackaged it and created a simple script to make the install / uninstall process easier on a Steam Deck! \
Several logos are bundled in this github repo, and they will randomize whenever Windows starts up!

If you are also using my dual boot [Clover script,](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot) for the Steam Deck then no need to install this as the Clover script already contains HackBGRT. \
This will also work on regular Windows PC / handhelds as long as SecureBoot is disabled and the config needs to be adjusted to match the screen resolution.


> **NOTE**\
> If you are going to use this script for a video tutorial, PLEASE reference on your video where you got the script! This will make the support process easier!
